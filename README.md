### Pull Request Template

#### Create a Pull Request from forked repo

1. Navigate to the original repository where you created your fork.
2. Above the list of files, click Pull request.
3. On the Compare page, click compare across forks.
4. In the "base branch" drop-down menu, select the branch of the upstream repository you'd like to merge changes into.
5. In the "head fork" drop-down menu, select your fork, then use the "compare branch" 6. drop-down menu to select the branch you made your changes in.
Type a title and description for your pull request.

#### Pull Request Title
First and Last Name
```
Jane Doe
```

#### Pull Request Description Format
Give a 1-5 rating in each of these categories to let us know how you are feeling on the material.

You can copy and paste the template below to use in your pull request submissions, then edit it to reflect your ratings.
```
### Comprehension
  1-5

  1. I am struggling with this deliverable
  3. I can complete this deliverable, but don't fully understand it
  5. I fully understand today's deliverable

### Completion
  1-5

  1. I have not met the requirements for this deliverable
  3. I have met all minimum requirements for this deliverable
  5. I have met all requirements + any bonuses for this deliverable


### Additional Comments

### Git Merge Conflicts

A **merge conflict** occurs when git merges two commits that have modified the same region of code and can't figure out whose code to use. Thus, fixing merge conflicts requires that a developer manually update the code to what it should be and re-commit it to resolve the conflict, which will also finish git's merge process.

Git informs you which files have merge conflicts and will _annotate_ your code to show you how your local code differs from the code being merged from the remote. An example of such annotation is below.

```
'<<<<<<< HEAD
// Local code is here
=======
// Changes you are pulling are here
>>>>>>> 75c37cea922afc56e7d686adba063b986013ca9f
```

Once you have resolved these merge conflicts by editing the code and removing the markers, you can `add` and `commit` normally.

During group project merge conflicts will likely occur giving you an opportunity to learn more about them then.
